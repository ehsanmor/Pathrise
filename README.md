# Pathrise Data Science Project

## Overview

This project is a data challenge assignment for Pathrise, an online program that provides mentorship, training, and advice to help job seekers get the best possible jobs in tech. The goal of this analysis is to derive insights around whether a fellow will ultimately be placed at a company and how long until a placement can be expected.

The provided data set contains information on fellows from the moment they joined the Pathrise program. The project requires deploying analytical techniques towards addressing the given questions and translating those findings into recommendations for Pathrise.

Data The data set provided contains the following variables:

cohort_tag: the cohort of the fellow. program_duration_days: the duration of the Pathrise program in days. placed: whether the fellow was placed at a company. employment_status: the employment status of the fellow. highest_level_of_education: the highest level of education of the fellow. length_of_job_search: the length of the job search before joining Pathrise. biggest_challenge_in_search: the biggest challenge faced by the fellow during the job search. professional_experience: the professional experience of the fellow. Analysis The analysis will focus on understanding the factors that influence a fellow's likelihood of being placed at a company and the time it takes for them to receive a final job offer. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends.

Various analytical techniques will be deployed, such as regression analysis and machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The models will be used to predict the likelihood of a fellow being placed at a company and the expected time until a placement can be expected.

Recommendations The analysis will provide insights into the factors that are most important in determining a fellow's success in the Pathrise program. Recommendations will be made based on the findings, including potential changes to the program to increase the success rate of fellows.

Conclusion Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into the Pathrise program and the factors that contribute to a fellow's success. The findings will help inform decisions on how to improve the program and better support fellows in achieving their career goals in tech..
